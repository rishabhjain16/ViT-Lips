# VIT-LIPS: Vision Transformer for Lip Reading

This project aims to implement a lip-reading model using a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. The model will be trained to predict spoken words or phonemes directly from silent video streams of a speaker's lips.

## Project Goal

The primary objective is to take pre-processed, lip-segmented video frames (such as those from the LRS3 dataset) and use a ViT-based model to transcribe the corresponding speech. The model will be trained using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, which is well-suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks where the alignment between input and output is not known.

## Key Components

*   **Input:** Lip-segmented video features.
*   **Model:** Vision Transformer (ViT).
*   **Loss Function:** CTC Loss.
*   **Output:** Transcribed sentences or phonemes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Roadmap

- [ ] Develop data loading and preprocessing pipeline for datasets like LRS3.
- [ ] Implement the Vision Transformer model with a CTC head.
- [ ] Create the training and validation scripts.
- [ ] Implement an inference/evaluation script.
- [ ] Add detailed usage instructions and results.
